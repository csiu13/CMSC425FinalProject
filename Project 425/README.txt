Paletter is a 2D puzzle platformer that makes mostly of Unity's physics engine to create
puzzles with dozens of different possible approaches for the player. The objective in
each level is to hit all of the switches which activates the goal. This can be completed
in any order, but there is emphasis on speed as the player's time is recorded for each level
and it displays their best time at the end of each level as well at the end of the game.
The game focuses on 4 different modes that the player can enter into:
-Air
-Fire
-Earth
-Water

Air mode allows the player to move in any direction they choose. While this is one of the safer
ways to travel around, it is much slower than the other modes. There is a very small gravitational
force on it if you don't press any direction but essentially you will be hovering in place.

Fire mode at the moment only has a double jump for movement which refreshes every time it touches
solid ground. This includes platforms, walls, etc. In addition, it can also shoot a projectile
in a straight line forwards. This projectile can activate switches if it hits them but it also is
destroyed upon collision with anything else.

Earth mode controls the player's gravity and is much faster compared to the other modes. The drawback
to it is that it can be quite tricky to control and finesse through some of the tigher areas of the
game. If on solid ground, the player can still move in the axis perpendicular from the current gravity.
So if the player has gravity going to the right and they are on a wall, they can move up or down along
the wall. As mentioned this mode is mostly used for its speed.

Water mode is in my opinion the most interesting. This mode allows the player to shrink or grow allowing
it to move through small gaps or get itself out of small gaps. Also while in this mode, the player will
be immune to spikes so they can traverse treacherous terrain easier. The catch is that the player will no
longer be able to jump. To compensate, the linear drag or friction is much lower for this mode and 
the player will gain speed much faster and keep momentum from other modes. This synergizes quite well with
Earth mode.

Every level in this game can be beaten, I've tested it. Some of the movement is difficult to master
and a few of the switches require some peculiar timings on the mode switches. But other than that,
I hope you enjoy playing my little game!
